🤖 Predictive Modeling – Data Science Internship Project

📌 Project Overview  
This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**. The goal was to predict restaurant ratings using regression models based on various features in the dataset.

📊 Dataset  
The dataset includes:
- Restaurant metadata (name, city, country, cuisines)
- Service features (table booking, online delivery)
- Price ranges and previous ratings

🛠️ Tech Stack  
Programming Language: Python  
Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

🔍 Workflow  
✅ Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
✅ Built multiple regression models to predict **Aggregate Rating**  
✅ Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20)  
✅ Applied and compared the following models:
- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor  
- Random Forest Regressor  
✅ Evaluated models using:
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)  
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)  
- R² Score

📈 Results  
- Trained and tested three models  
- Identified the best-performing model based on accuracy and error metrics  
- Gained insights into the key features influencing restaurant ratings

🚀 Key Learnings  
- Understood model training, testing, and evaluation in a regression context  
- Learned the importance of model comparison and metric-based validation  
- Strengthened hands-on experience in building real-world ML solutions

🌟 Acknowledgment
